# browser-battery-testing

This project isn't so much about the code as it is a way to access the Keyboard Maestro macro used for testing, as well as making available some of the data I collected on my Mac using the test. Those who are interested in data analysis might be able to do something interesting with it if they wanted.

Read [the original blog post](https://birchtree.me/blog/everyone-says-chrome-devastates-mac-battery-life-but-does-it-i-tested-for-36-hours-to-find-out/) going through testing methods to see my initial results using an earlier version of this test.
